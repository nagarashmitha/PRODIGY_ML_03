# PRODIGY_ML_03
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. Using a subset of the popular Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset
, the model is trained to distinguish between cat and dog images based on their pixel features.

Unlike deep learning approaches, this project uses a traditional machine learning algorithm (SVM) for image classification, making it suitable for learning the fundamentals of feature extraction, preprocessing, and classical machine learning techniques on image data.

Key Features

Dataset: Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset (preprocessed for training)

Preprocessing: Images resized, flattened, and normalized for SVM input

Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and RBF kernel options

Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance

Learning Outcome: Understand classical ML image classification, SVM mechanics, and image preprocessing techniques
